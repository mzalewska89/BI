# BI Projects #
This repository is to show my training BI projects. 

## Project 1 ##
### Tableau ### 
It is my first, very simple project done in the Tableau Public during an online course. The dataset used is related to the AirBnB in Seattle in 2016, The idea of the presentation is to analize and visualize the data to a businessman who thinks about entering the business. It shows the analysis as follows. 
* Averege price per Bedroom
* Price by Zipcode (in numbers/bars and geographically)
* Count of listing ordered by the number of bedrooms 
* Revenue in course of the year

<br>The dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnB_Seattle_FullProject/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
